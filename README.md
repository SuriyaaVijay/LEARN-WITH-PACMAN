"Learn with Pac-Man" is an action maze chase video game; the player controls the eponymous Pac-Man character through an enclosed maze. 
The objective of the game is to eat all of the HEALTHY FRUITS placed in the maze while avoiding JUNK FOODS — Cola, Pizza, Burger — that pursue Pac-Man. When Pac-Man eats all of the fruits, the player wins the level. 
Levels can be chosen from the Menu screen. 
Modern Render to this Classic game

Each level provides 3 lives for Pac-Man. If Pac-Man is caught by a Junk Food, he will lose a life; the game ends when all lives are lost.

Numbers make up the maze. Number 1 is a left corner. Numbers 2, 4 and 8 represent top, right, and bottom corners respectively. Number 16 is a point. These numbers can be added, for example number 19 in the upper left corner means that the square will have top and left borders and a point (16 + 2 + 1).
